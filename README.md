# AHB2APB-bridge-design-using-Verilog-HDL.
The AHB2APB bridge design is implemented in Verilog HDL for read, write, read burst, write burst and write transfers, and all these designs are simulated using the Xilinx ISE software. By implementing the timeout concept, data loss can be minimized, and the design can become more extensible.
